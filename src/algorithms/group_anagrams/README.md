# Group Anagrams

**Difficulty:** Medium

Given an array of strings `strs`, group **the anagrams** together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1:

```txt
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

## Example 2:

```txt
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

## Example 3:

```txt
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

## Constraints:

- <code>1 <= strs.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- <code>0 <= strs[i].length <= 100</code>
- <code>strs[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.
