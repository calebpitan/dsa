# Swap Nodes in Pairs

**Difficulty:** Medium

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

## Example 1:

![LinkedList](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/swap_ex1.jpg)

```txt
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

## Example 2:

```txt
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## Example 3:

```txt
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
